title: Taxonomy Alignment in the iSchool Knowledge Organization Curriculum

# Relevance and significance

Mapping or alignment of taxonomies and controlled vocabularies has
been an active research area for decades, and the increasing variety
of resources tagged with competing, publicly documented descriptor
sets presents new challenges to information professionals every
year. Entire conferences are now dedicated to reconciliation problems
that are narrowly scoped in comparison to the range of methods
proposed and tested during the last fifty years. What role does (or
may) this rich history and current practice inform our courses on
knowledge organization and resource description? The appeal of this
event will be an opportunity to explore these questions by drawing on
choices made and lessons learned during a shared hands-on exercise.

# Purpose and Intended Audience

The main audience for this activity will be those iSchool faculty
actively teaching classes in knowledge organization, classification,
metadata, thesaurus construction, ontology development, and principles
of resource analysis and description. It may also be of interest to
faculty who teach broader required survey courses or who participate
on iSchool curriculum committees. Participants will be invited to
share a taxonomy alignment exercise during the months leading up to
iConference 2018, and to use the outcomes, results, and lessons from
that exercise as foci for a discussion of what our students should
know about reconciling competing description standards. Goals for the
session include:

1. Prompting a discussion of how current vocabulary alignment and
   reconciliation problems do or should inform the broader learning
   outcomes of our graduate education programs; 

2. Eliciting a comparison of methods, tools, and interchange formats
   employed by participants in the alignment exercise and a discussion
   of their potential for enriching student experiences in the classroom;

3. Informing reflection on learning experiences outside the classroom, such
   as student participation in research and practica.

# Proposed Activities

The exercise involves a small set of related vocabularies and an
invitation to employ any tools, strategies and choices participants
wish for aligning or mapping those languages to each other. The data
consist of sixteen OWL ontologies all related to conference
organization, and collected as part of the OntoFarm Project
[^1]. Participants may work with any two or more of those they
wish. Participants may take advantage of as much expressive power of
the original files as they choose, or reduce the data to a simpler
form, such as generic hierarchical and associative relationships
(e.g., SKOS).  They may even choose to discard all term relationships,
and base their alignment on lexical resemblance alone.

The project website (https://taxalignmentworkshop.github.io/) will go
live on November 1, with instructions for participants, links to the
data, a repository for sharing results, and a forum for coordination
and discussion. Participants may join the activity and discussions at
any time during the months of November through February, but alignment
preparation will discontinue after February 28, and we will devote the
first two weeks of March to wrap up forum discussions and prepare a
discussion agenda for the iConference session.

We request one 90 minute session during iSchools 2018. The repository
of illustrations and examples that emerge from participants' alignment
work will remain online after the conference concludes.
