**2018 SIE Call**

Sessions for Interaction and Engagement (SIEs) are activities that
involve participants as more than a passive audience, such as by:

-   introducing **engaging topics that invite commentary from the
    > participants**, or

-   being **directly engaging**, through search contests, design
    > sessions, hackathons, creativity spaces, or sessions that invite
    > the participants to vote on, for example, ethical issues or policy
    > ramifications, and then to talk more about the issues raised, or

-   providing a **space for learning, reflection, and
    > relationship-building** through interactive installations or
    > exhibitions

**Abstract**: A **150-word abstract** to be published in the program
schedule.

**Description**: A description of the event of up to **1,000 words**,
addressing each of the following:

-   **Purpose and Intended Audience:** Please state the audience to
    > which your event is designed to appeal and the goals and/or
    > expected outcomes for your event.

-   **Proposed activities including agenda, ramp-up (development), and
    > follow-through:** Describe how your event will be organized. The
    > format is up to you: we welcome creative ideas for lively events
    > of all kinds. To advance beyond “sage on the stage,” explain the
    > strategies you will use to engage session attendees. Also, please
    > comment if you plan to prepare a report, proceedings, wiki, or
    > website to disseminate the results of your event as follow-up.

-   **Relevance to the Conference/Significance to the Field**: Briefly
    > state the focus of your proposal topic and note the importance,
    > relevance, value, and/or interest to the broad iSchool community.
    > Provide a brief explanation of how this event will appeal to the
    > audience both with respect to content and format.

**Duration**: Indicate the number of 90-minute sessions your event will
require.



Notes / key points:

-   theme: what are we, could we teach in the “target space” (KO; also
    > see below)

-   target audience:

    -   iSchool faculty teaching knowledge organization courses;
        > metadata; ontology construction; etc.

-   ahead of time:

    -   organizers conduct some hands-on exercises, work with use cases,
        > tools

    -   connect methods and lessons learned from the exercises to
        > learning objectives and pedagogical goals at iSchool classes
        > on KO

-   during the session:

    -   comparison of exercise results

    -   social dimension: how working with these tools, exercises has
        > influenced, changed, other activities at the iSchool
        > (seminars, activities across classes?, ..)

    -   discussion

Bertram and I are preparing a workshop proposal on taxonomy
alignment in iSchools curricula. We have in mind a hands on exercise
along these lines:

1.  Organizers agree on two ontologies/vocabularies that admit different
    > strategies and choices for how they could be aligned with or
    > mapped to each other.

2.  All participants are invited to prepare specific alignment
    > proposals, using whatever methods or tools they like.

3.  We share and compare the alignments in advance of the March meeting
    > in Sheffield.

4.  We use the limited face-to-face time at iSchools 2018 for a
    > discussion of what our students should know about taxonomy
    > alignment, using the outcomes from the exercise as discussion foci
    > and illustration.


Title: Taxonomy Alignment in the iSchool Knowledge Organization Curriculum

# Abstract

Mapping or alignment of taxonomies and controlled vocabularies has
been an active research area for decades, and the increasing variety
of resources tagged with competing, publicly documented descriptor
sets presents new challenges to information professionals every
year. Entire conferences are now dedicated to reconciliation problems
that are narrowly scoped in comparison to the range of methods
proposed and tested during the last fifty years. What role does (or
may) this rich history and current practice inform our courses on
knowledge organization and resource description? Participants in this
session are invited to share a taxonomy alpwd



ignment exercise during the
months leading up to iConference 2018, and to use the outcomes,
results, and lessons from that exercise as foci for a discussion of
what our students should know about reconciling competing description
standards. For details consult the project website:
https://taxalignmentworkshop.github.io/



The exercise consists of a small set of related
vocabularies and an invitation to employ any tools, strategies and
choices they wish for aligning or mapping those languages to each
other.
